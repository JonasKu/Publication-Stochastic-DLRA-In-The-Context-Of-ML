# Stochastic dynamical low-rank approximation in the context of machine learning

This repository collects the numerical test cases for the manuscript "Stochastic dynamical low-rank approximation in the context of machine learning". All numerical experiments are computed with Pytorch, Version 2.7. To run all experiments, simply install the virtual environment with the requirements.txt file. This will install all required packages. You can reproduce all numerical experiments by running the main files in your virtual environment.
